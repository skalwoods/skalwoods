- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skalwoods
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, programming languages, data analysis and computational thinking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in school for IT, Networking and Cybersecurity, and am working on some of the industry standard certifications at the same time. Python is my first and only language at the moment with any sort of proficiency. HTML is a close second. Java is next!
